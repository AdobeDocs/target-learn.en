## Overview

* The SPA VEC can be used to create A/B and Auto-Allocate tests and Experience Targeting (XT) activities
* The SPA VEC does not support Auto Target, Automated Personalization, or Recommendations activities
* The SPA VEC supports A4T, Experience Cloud Audiences, and Customer Attributes integrations
* All VEC actions are supported in single page apps, including custom code
* VEC actions can be applied to a single view or to the page load event
* Different modifications can be added to different views without having to use the "Additional Pages" option  
* at.js 2.0+ and the adobe.target.triggerView() function must be implemented in the app before you can use the SPA VEC
