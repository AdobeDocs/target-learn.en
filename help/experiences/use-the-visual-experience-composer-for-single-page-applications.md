# Using the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] for Single Page Applications (SPA VEC) in Adobe Target

The SPA VEC enables marketers to create tests and personalize content in SPAs in a do-it-yourself fashion without continuous development dependencies. The VEC can be used to create A/B Tests and Experience Targeting (XT) activities in apps built with popular frameworks, such as React and Angular. Watch the following video to learn how to create activities using the SPA VEC.

## Overview

* The SPA VEC can be used to create A/B and Auto-Allocate tests and Experience Targeting (XT) activities
* The SPA VEC does not support Auto Target, Automated Personalization, or Recommendations activities
* The SPA VEC supports A4T, [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud Audiences], and [!UICONTROL Customer Attributes] integrations
* All VEC actions are supported in single page apps, including custom code
* VEC actions can be applied to a single view or to the page load event
* Different modifications can be added to different views without having to use the [!UICONTROL Additional Pages] option  
* `at.js 2.0+` and the `adobe.target.triggerView()` function must be implemented in the app before you can use the SPA VEC

## Intended Audience

* Business Practitioner
