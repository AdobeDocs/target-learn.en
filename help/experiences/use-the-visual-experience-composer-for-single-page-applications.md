# Using the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] for Single Page Applications (SPA VEC) in Adobe Target

The SPA VEC enables marketers to create tests and personalize content in SPAs in a do-it-yourself fashion without continuous development dependencies. 

* The SPA VEC can be used to create A/B and Auto-Allocate tests and Experience Targeting (XT) activities
* The SPA VEC does not support Auto Target, Automated Personalization, or Recommendations activities
* The SPA VEC supports A4T, [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud Audiences], and [!UICONTROL Customer Attributes] integrations
* All VEC actions are supported in single page apps, including custom code
* VEC actions can be applied to a single view or to the page load event
* Different modifications can be added to different views without having to use the [!UICONTROL Additional Pages] option  
* `at.js 2.0+` and the `adobe.target.triggerView()` function must be implemented in the app before you can use the SPA VEC

## Intended audience

* Business Practitioner
