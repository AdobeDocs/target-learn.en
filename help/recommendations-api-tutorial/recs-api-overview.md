# Adobe Recommendations API Overview

APIs relevant for [!DNL Recommendations] include [admin APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/apis/api-overview.html?lang=en) that allow you to:

* Manage your catalog of recommendable products or content
* Manage your [!DNL Recommendations] algorithms and activities

Using the [!DNL Target] [delivery API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/apis/api-overview.html?lang=en) with Recommendations, you can also:

* Retrieve recommendations in JSON, HTML, or XML objects so they can be displayed in web, mobile, email, Internet of Things (IOT), and other channels.

## Tutorial Description

This tutorial walks developers through hands-on practice using the [!DNL Recommendations] APIs to configure and manage [!DNL Recommendations] catalogs and custom criteria, as well as using the delivery API to retrieve recommendations content. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Configure and manage entities using the Recommendations API
* Configure and manage custom criteria using the Recommendations API
* Understand how to use Recommendations with the Delivery API to use recommendations results in non-HTML devices

## Audience

This tutorial is intended for developers new to Target APIs or Recommendations APIs.

## Pre-requisites

Using the Target admin APIs requires [Adobe authentication setup](https://developer.adobe.com/target/before-administer/configure-authentication/){target=_blank}. Make sure you have this configured prior to beginning this tutorial.
